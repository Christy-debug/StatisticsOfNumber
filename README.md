# StatisticsOfNumber
Start with an input listof valuesread from STDIN.
Compute and output the count, minimum, maximum, mean, and median of the valid input values, as well as an error count. 
For the mean and median, roundand display the results to the nearest hundredth.

Input is a potentially empty listof values, one per line
For output, If one of the statisticshas no value or cannot be computed, output 'n/a' for its value

Constraints
Only positive integers are valid input values. All other input values should be counted as errors and should not stop the program from reading further input values
